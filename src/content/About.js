           <p>
           With 4 years of experience in the hospitality industry, im always looking for ways to improve my skills and to become a better professional.
With countless certifications of voluntary work in the events industry, I've learned how to team work with my colleagues.
I like to try different things and find different ways of finishing a task faster with the same successful outcome.
