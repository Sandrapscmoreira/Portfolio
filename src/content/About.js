           <h3>Hello! I am Sandra Moreira, a React Developer (and still learner) and a Hospitality worker looking for my next adventure!</h3>
           <br/>
           <p>
           With 4 years of experience in the hospitality industry, I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills and to become a better professional.
With countless certifications of voluntary work in the events industry, I've learned how to team work with my colleagues and how to work smart.
I like to try different things and find different ways of finishing a task faster with the same successful outcome.

           <p>After moving to England in 2018 to join the University, I engaged in countless work experiences
               provided by my course and gained the independence and skills to work with finances, project managements, 
               managing people and designing marketing materials for the different projects.
